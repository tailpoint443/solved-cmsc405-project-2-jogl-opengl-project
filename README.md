<strong>Overview </strong>

In this project you will create a unique 3 graphics scene composed of OpenGL graphic components using transformation methods.

<strong>Requirements: </strong>

<ol>

 <li>Using Netbeans or Eclipse, develop a JOGL application that displays a unique 3D scene. The scene has the following specifications:

  <ol>

   <li>Size: minimum 640×480</li>

   <li>Includes at least 6 different shapes</li>

   <li>Uses at least 6 different transformation methods</li>

  </ol></li>

</ol>




<ol start="2">

 <li>Use Java and JOGL for your implementation of OpenGL</li>

 <li>All Java source code should be written using Google Java style guide.</li>

 <li>Prepare, conduct and document a test plan verifying your application is working as expected. This plan should include a test matrix listing each method you tested, how you tested it, and the results of testing.</li>

</ol>
